The error messages related to `libGL` and issues with creating a GLX screen or loading drivers like `vc4` typically indicate problems with OpenGL rendering and hardware acceleration. This kind of issue is common when trying to run graphical applications that require 3D acceleration in environments where the necessary hardware drivers are either not available or not configured correctly.

Here's how to address these issues for running RViz or other OpenGL-dependent applications over remote connections and within containers:

### 1. **Using Software Rendering**

For testing purposes or in cases where hardware acceleration is problematic, you can force the application to use software rendering. This is not ideal for performance but can bypass issues related to hardware drivers.

- **Set the `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE` environment variable**:
  ```bash
  export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
  ```

  Adding this to your Docker run command can help:
  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -e LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    your-docker-image
  ```

### 2. **Correct Driver Installation on the Host**

Ensure that the host machine (the remote computer) has the correct graphics drivers installed. The error message mentioning `vc4` suggests it's related to Broadcom's VideoCore IV GPU, often used in devices like Raspberry Pi.

- **Install or update drivers**: On many Linux systems, you can install drivers using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, ensure you have the latest drivers by checking for proprietary drivers or using the standard Mesa libraries:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
  ```

### 3. **Configuring Xorg**

If using Xorg as your display server, ensure it's configured to allow indirect GLX contexts, which might be disabled by default due to security concerns.

- **Modify the Xorg configuration**:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
  ```
  And add or ensure the following is in the configuration:
  ```plaintext
  Section "ServerFlags"
      Option "AllowIndirectGLX" "on"
      Option "IndirectGLX" "on"
  EndSection
  ```
  Restart the X server after making these changes.

### 4. **VirtualGL**

For better handling of OpenGL over remote connections, consider using VirtualGL. VirtualGL redirects 3D commands to a graphics card on the server side, which can help in situations where direct rendering is not possible or practical over remote connections.

- **Install VirtualGL** on the remote machine:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install virtualgl
  ```
- **Configure VirtualGL**:
  ```bash
  vglserver_config
  ```
- **Run your Docker container with VirtualGL**:
  ```bash
  vglrun docker run -it --rm \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    your-docker-image
  ```

### 5. **Check Docker Configuration**

Ensure that your Docker configuration allows the container to access the host's GPU. This can be done using the `--device` flag to pass the GPU devices into the container.

### Conclusion

By experimenting with these solutions, you should be able to address the issues with OpenGL rendering and hardware acceleration, either by bypassing the need for direct hardware access through software rendering or by ensuring the correct drivers and configurations are in place for OpenGL to function properly over remote connections.
